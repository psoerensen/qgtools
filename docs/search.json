They are declared in the model formula as a named effect (e.g. (1 | id)), and linked to genotype data via a featureMatrix().\nRegularization and covariance structure are then specified through marker-level priors, such as bayesC(), optionally using featureSets to define multiple variance components over disjoint (or annotated) subsets of markers.\nThis approach mirrors how marker effects are handled in software such as BGLR and BayesR, while preserving a clear separation between:\n\nmodel structure (formulas and named effects),\ndata representation (feature matrices and feature sets), and\ninference (Bayesian priors or REML/solver-based estimation).\n\nUnlike classical low-dimensional random effects, marker effects are not associated with explicit covariance matrices at the observation level. Instead, their covariance is induced implicitly through the feature matrix and the prior, enabling scalable multi-component and multi-trait models."
