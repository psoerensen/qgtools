# Human example (PLINK-based)

This example demonstrates how qgtools can work with standard PLINK
binary genotype files together with phenotype and covariate data.

## Files

- `human.bed`, `human.bim`, `human.fam`
  - PLINK binary genotype files

- `human.pheno`
  - Phenotype file

- `human.covar`
  - Covariate file

## Intended usage

This example mirrors a typical GWAS workflow where:
- genotypes are stored in PLINK format
- phenotypes and covariates are provided separately

The files are simulated and kept small for illustration purposes.
