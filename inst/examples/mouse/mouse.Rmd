# Mouse example (CSV-based)

This example demonstrates how qgtools can integrate phenotype data,
pedigree information, and marker data stored in plain text files.

## Files

- `mouse.csv`
  - Phenotypes and covariates
  - Columns include: `id`, traits, and fixed effects

- `pedigree.csv`
  - Pedigree information
  - Columns: `id`, `sire`, `dam`, `date_of_birth`

- `genotypes.csv`
  - Marker genotypes
  - First column `id`, remaining columns are markers (`M1`, `M2`, ...)

## Intended usage

This example is suitable for:
- additive genetic models using pedigree kernels
- marker-based models using disk-backed genotype data
- demonstration and testing purposes

All files are intentionally small and human-readable.
