\title{Create a FeatureSource object}
\usage{
makeFeatureSource(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named feature objects (e.g. Glist, FeatureBackend)}
}
\value{
An object of class "FeatureSource"
}
\description{
Describe one or more high-dimensional feature sources (e.g. genotypes,
omics, image-derived features) used in a qgtools model.
}
\details{
Each feature source must define:
\itemize{
\item row identifiers (e.g. individual IDs)
\item column identifiers (e.g. marker IDs, features)
}

These identifiers are used to align features with the DataSource
(via row IDs) and with model components such as variance components
and feature sets (via column IDs).
}
