\usage{
makePEDlist(
  fnPED = NULL,
  format = c("SIMPLE", "DMU", "PLINK", "CUSTOM"),
  encoding = c("ASCII", "BINARY"),
  method = "S-D-NonInbred",

}
\arguments{
\item{fnPED}{Character. Path to the pedigree file.}

\item{format}{Character. Pedigree format specification. One of
\code{"DMU"}, \code{"SIMPLE"}, \code{"PLINK"}, or \code{"CUSTOM"}.}

\item{encoding}{Character. One of \code{"ASCII"} or \code{"BINARY"}.
ASCII input is expected to conform to INTEGER\emph{4 and REAL}4 ranges.
Binary input must follow unformatted Fortran conventions.}

\item{method}{Character. Pedigree relationship construction method.}

\item{columns}{Optional named character vector or list defining column
mappings for \code{format = "CUSTOM"}.}

\description{
Pedigree kernels are standalone objects and can be reused across variance
components and model fits.
}
\details{
Create a pedigree data specification object (\code{PEDlist}) used to define
the structure of additive genetic relationships based on pedigree information.

By default, \code{makePEDlist()} assumes a simple pedigree format with columns
identifying individual, sire, dam, and an optional ordering variable.

The \code{PEDlist} object contains no phenotype or model-specific information.
Linking pedigree records to analysis data is handled at a higher (model) level.

The pedigree file (or data frame) must contain information identifying
individuals and their parents. The exact interpretation of columns depends
on the selected pedigree \code{format}.

For formats that support inbreeding, a sorting variable (e.g. birth date) may
be required; otherwise it may be set to 0.

When phantom parent grouping is used, unknown parents must be replaced by
negative group codes to distinguish them from regular individual IDs.

\examples{
## DMU-compatible pedigree (default use case)
\dontrun{
PED_dmu <- makePEDlist(
  fnPED    = "pedigree.txt",
  format   = "DMU",
  encoding = "ASCII",
  method   = "S-D-NonInbred"
)
}

## Simple text pedigree (ID, sire, dam, optional order)
\dontrun{
PED_simple <- makePEDlist(
  fnPED  = "ped.txt",
  format = "SIMPLE"
)
}

## PLINK .fam pedigree
\dontrun{
PED_plink <- makePEDlist(
  fnPED  = "data.fam",
  format = "PLINK"
)
}

## Custom pedigree schema with user-defined column mapping
\dontrun{
PED_custom <- makePEDlist(
  fnPED  = "ped.txt",
  format = "CUSTOM",
  columns = list(
    id    = "animal",
    sire  = "father",
    dam   = "mother",
    order = "birth_year"
  )
)
}
