\description{
Pedigree kernels are standalone objects and can be reused across variance components and model fits.

\details{
Create a pedigree data specification object (\code{PEDlist}) used to define
the structure of additive genetic relationships based on pedigree information.

The \code{PEDlist} object contains no phenotype or model-specific information.
Linking pedigree records to analysis data is handled at a higher (model) level.

The pedigree file (or data frame) must contain four integer columns: individual ID,
sire ID, dam or maternal grandsire ID, and a sorting variable (e.g. birth date).
The sorting variable is only required when modeling inbreeding; otherwise it may
be set to 0.

The individual IDs in the pedigree file must correspond to the identifiers used
for the random genetic effect in the model. If the model includes merged random
genetic effects (e.g. direct and maternal effects), pedigree information must be
provided for all effects.

When phantom parent grouping is used, unknown parents must be replaced by
negative group codes to distinguish them from regular individual IDs.

The \code{method} argument controls how the additive genetic relationship
matrix is constructed from the pedigree:
\itemize{
\item \code{"S-D-Inbred"}: Sires and dams, assuming an inbred population.
\item \code{"S-D-NonInbred"}: Sires and dams, assuming a non-inbred population.
\item \code{"S-MGS-Inbred"}: Sires and maternal grandsires, assuming an inbred population.
\item \code{"S-MGS-NonInbred"}: Sires and maternal grandsires, assuming a non-inbred population.
\item \code{"S-D-NonInbred-PP"}: Sires and dams, non-inbred population, with grouping
of unknown (phantom) parents.
}
}
