\usage{
vc(index, traits, kernel = NULL, structure = "unstructured", prior = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{Character. Grouping variable indexing the random effect.}

\item{traits}{Character vector of trait names.}

\item{kernel}{Kernel object defining covariance across index levels.}

\item{structure}{Character. Declared trait covariance structure
("unstructured", "diagonal", or "identity"). This parameter is currently
informational and may be used for validation or default prior construction
in future versions.}

\item{prior}{Optional prior specification object.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"vc"}.
}
\description{
Define a variance component (random effect) in a mixed or hierarchical model.
Each variance component:
\itemize{
\item corresponds to a random effect in the model formulas,
\item is indexed by a grouping factor (\code{index}),
\item uses a kernel to induce covariance across index levels, and
\item may optionally specify a prior on variance or covariance parameters.
}
}
\details{
Covariance may be induced explicitly (e.g. via pedigree or GRM-based kernels
with variance–covariance priors) or implicitly through model structure, such
as marker-based effects where covariance arises from genotypes, LD, and
marker-level priors.

The \code{index} must match the grouping factor used for the corresponding
random effect in the model formulas.

The interpretation of variance and covariance parameters depends on the
analysis context and the combination of kernel and prior used. Some variance
components imply explicit variance–covariance matrices, while others induce
covariance implicitly without forming such matrices.
