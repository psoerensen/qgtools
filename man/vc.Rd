informational and may be used for validation or default prior construction
in future versions.}

\description{
Define a variance component (random effect) in a mixed or hierarchical model.
Each variance component:
\itemize{
\item corresponds to a random effect in the model formulas,
\item is indexed by a grouping factor (\code{index}),
\item uses a kernel to induce covariance across index levels, and
\item may optionally specify starting values and/or prior distributions
for variance or covariance parameters.
}
}
\details{
Covariance may be induced explicitly (e.g. via pedigree or GRM-based kernels
with variance–covariance parameters) or implicitly through model structure,
such as marker-based effects where covariance arises from genotypes, LD, and
marker-level priors.

The \code{index} must match the grouping factor used for the corresponding
random effect in the model formula.
The \code{index} is the name of the grouping variable and must correspond
exactly to the \code{(1 | index)} term in the model formula.

The interpretation of supplied variance and covariance information depends on
the analysis task:
\itemize{
\item \strong{REML}: \code{start} values are used as starting values.
\item \strong{Bayesian}: \code{prior} specifies prior distributions.
\item \strong{Solve}: \code{start} values are treated as fixed parameters.
}

Not all kernels imply explicit variance–covariance matrices. For example,
marker-based kernels may induce covariance implicitly without forming such
matrices.
