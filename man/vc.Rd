\description{
Define a variance component associated with a latent model variable
(random effect) in a mixed or hierarchical model.
}
\details{
A variance component:
\itemize{
\item references a latent indexing variable (as used in model formulas),
\item attaches exactly one covariance mechanism (kernel or featureMatrix),
\item defines trait-level covariance structure,
\item optionally provides starting values.
}

Multiple variance components may reference the same \code{variable}.
This allows covariance decomposition of a single random effect into
multiple components (e.g. pedigree + marker-based variation).

For example, additive genetic variation indexed by \code{id}
may include:
\itemize{
\item a pedigree-based kernel component, and
\item one or more feature-based components.
}

The residual component must use \code{variable = "residual"} and
must not be kernel- or feature-backed.
}
